If all the entries are correct then a USER ID and PASSWORD is given to the voter, by using that ID and PASSWORD they can use their vote. If conditions are wrong then that entry will be discarded.

OBJECTIVES

The most crucial factor for a system like e-VOTE to be successful is to exhibit a Voting Protocol that can prevent opportunities for fraud or for sacrificing the voter's privacy
The Voting Protocol that will be designed and implemented for the e-VOTE system will combine the advantages of existing protocols and techniques, while at the same time it will aim at eliminating most of the identified deficiencies and problems. The related attributes that the eVOTE system will fully support, and against which it will be extensively tested and validated, are listed below. These attributes can be also considered, according to the literature, as a set of criteria for a "good" electronic voting system that can easily enjoy the trust and confidence of the voters and process organizers.

FUTURE SCOPE
